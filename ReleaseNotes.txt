Changes from 1.2 to 1.3:
* Changed the graphics from the default starting graphics to new graphics.
* Trying to Execute the Edit.Copy/Cut commands when the Project Properties window had focus was throwing an exception. If Edit.Copy/Cut command fails to execute, the code now gets the bindings for the Edit.Copy/Cut, and then uses SendKeys to simulate clicking those keys. For instance, the Edit.Copy command is by default bound to Ctrl+C AND Ctrl+Ins. So if you remove Ctrl+C as a binding, but leave Ctrl+Ins intact, this extension will hit the keyboard keys of Ctrl+Ins if Edit.Copy fails.
